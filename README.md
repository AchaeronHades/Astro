A cute little voice assistant for your desk.

First, thank you to to RealDeco for allowing me to cannibalise his code - mine could be a bit of a mess, but it seems to work.

Next, this is really just a proof of concept - I wanted something for my 5yo daughter to get excited about, and she absolutely loves it.

What this does/contains - 

- Animated phases
- Integration with ESPHome/Home Assistant/Voice Assist
- Files for both the V1 and the V2 "Xiaozhi" Spotpear Balls

I'll add some refinement to it at some point, but as a father of two kids, and with a full time job, I have limited time (and soooo many other projects on the backburner).

Feel free to fork and edit as you please!
